# Python3 EDA projects

This repository includes Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating data manipulation techniques using pandas and other Python libraries. Youâ€™ll find examples demonstrating data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and more on how to derive different insights from sample datasets.
Feel free to explore the repository and learn from the projects provided. 

* **Objective:** Analyze datasets to understand their main characteristics, detect patterns, and uncover relationships.
  
* **Tools and Libraries:** 
* Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and numerical calculations.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualizations.



## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3
* pandas

Once you have those installed, you can clone the repository and run the following command to install the dependencies:

## Usage

To use one of the projects in this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the project's `.py` file in a text editor.
2. Edit the `DATA_PATH` variable to point to the location of the dataset file.
3. Run the `.py` file.

The `.py` files will load the dataset, perform some EDA, and print the results to the console.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

* **[Project_1_Sample_store_data, Project_2_python_ictionaries, Project_3_fruits_data, Project_4_employees_data ]:**  All these projects use EDA to explore different datasets inside the repository. These datasets contain various numbers of rows and columns, and different data types altogether.
