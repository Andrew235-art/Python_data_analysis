# Python3 EDA projects

This repository contains a collection of Python3 projects that use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to explore and understand data. These projects mainly use the Python Pandas library to perform EDA on a variety of datasets.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3
* pandas

Once you have those installed, you can clone the repository and run the following command to install the dependencies:

## Usage

To use one of the projects in this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the project's `.py` file in a text editor.
2. Edit the `DATA_PATH` variable to point to the location of the dataset file.
3. Run the `.py` file.

The `.py` files will load the dataset, perform some EDA, and print the results to the console.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

* **[Project_1_Sample_store_data, Project_2_python_ictionaries, Project_3_fruits_data, Project_4_employees_data ]:**  All these projects use EDA to explore different datasets inside the repository. These datasets contain various numbers of rows and columns, and different data types altogether.
