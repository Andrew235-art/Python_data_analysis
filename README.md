# Python EDA projects

## Overview

This repository includes Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating data manipulation techniques using pandas and other Python libraries. Youâ€™ll find examples demonstrating data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and more on how to derive different insights from sample datasets.

Feel free to explore the repository and learn from the projects provided. 

* **Objective:** Analyze datasets to understand their main characteristics, detect patterns, and uncover relationships.
  
* **Tools and Libraries:** 
  * Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and numerical calculations.
  * Matplotlib for data visualizations.

## Usage

To use one of the projects in this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the project's `.py` file in a text editor.
2. Edit the `DATA_PATH` variable to point to the location of the dataset file.
3. Run the `.py` file.

The `.py` files will load the dataset, perform some EDA, and print the results to the console.

        * Data Cleaning:
           Clean and prepare raw data (e.g., handle missing data and outliers, encode variables).
        * More Data Wrangling/Manipulation:
           Manipulate data (e.g., add/remove features, handle categorical variables).
        * Exploratory Data Analysis:
            Summarize data features, visualize patterns, and derive insights.
        * Visualization:
            Create dynamic plots and charts to visualize trends and patterns within sample datasets.
        * Insights:
            Provide valuable insights.
